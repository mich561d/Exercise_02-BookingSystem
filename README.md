# Exercise_03-BookingSystem
By Michael Due

## Requirements
It must be possible to create customers, employees and bookings. A customer may have a phone number (this change requires a database migration script). When booking an appointment with a customer, an SMS must be sent.

## Status
[x] Setup project
[x] DataLayer - BookingStorage
[x] DataLayer - BookingStorageImpl
[x] DataLayer - EmployeeStorage
[x] DataLayer - EmployeeStorageImpl
[x] ServiceLayer - BookingService
[x] ServiceLayer - BookingServiceImpl
[x] ServiceLayer - EmployeeService

## Test
Since there was no requirements to add new test, I have not added any new test. But I have made exsisting ones green after adding new functionality.
